* Modify Metadata

The public sequence resource uses multiple data formats listed on the
[[./download][DOWNLOAD]] page. One of the most exciting features is the full support
for RDF and semantic web/linked data ontologies. This technology
allows for querying data in unprescribed ways - that is, you can
formulate your own queries without dealing with a preset model of that
data (so typical of CSV files and SQL tables). Examples of exploring
data are listed [[./blog?id=using-covid-19-pubseq-part1][here]].

In this BLOG we are going to look at the metadata entered on the
[[./][COVID-19 PubSeq]] website (or command line client). It is important to
understand that you and us can change that information.

* What is the schema?

* How is the website generated?
