  This is the COVID-19 Public Sequence Resource (COVID-19 PubSeq) for
  SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences. COVID-19 PubSeq is a repository for
  sequences with a low barrier to entry for uploading sequence data
  using best practices. I.e., data published with a creative commons
  CC0 or CC-4.0 license with metadata using state-of-the art standards
  and, perhaps most importantly, providing standardised workflows that
  get triggered on upload, so that results are immediately available
  in standardised data formats.

  Your uploaded sequence will automatically be processed and
  incorporated into the public pangenome with metadata using worklows
  from the High Performance Open Biology Lab
  defined <a href="https://github.com/hpobio-lab/viral-analysis/tree/master/cwl/pangenome-generate">here</a>. Importantly, all
  data is published under
  a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative
  Commons license</a> (CC0 or CC-BY-4.0). Anyone can take the
  published (GFA/RDF/FASTA) data and use it for
  further processing.
